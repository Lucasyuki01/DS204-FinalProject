# DS204 â€” Final Project: Analysis for Data Science  

This repository contains the final group project for **DS204 â€” Analysis for Data Science**.  
The project focuses on performing a complete **data quality analysis** and **association study** on a real-world dataset.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The main objectives of this project are:  
- **Dataset Selection**: Import a dataset from an authentic online source (Kaggle, UCI, Data.gov, etc.) with sufficient numerical features for correlation and regression analysis.  
- **Data Quality Profiling**: Generate a detailed data quality report using `ydata_profiling` (or `DataPrep`) including missing values, duplicates, distributions, data types, and correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall).  
- **Association Analysis**: Identify 2â€“3 meaningful associations between features, interpret correlation strength, and define explanatory vs. response variables.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Detect and fix quality issues (missing values, duplicates, skewness, outliers, incorrect data types) with clear rationale.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Suggest an appropriate **linear regression model** (or justified alternatives) based on the identified associations.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables  
- âœ… Jupyter Notebook (fully reproducible, with code and explanations).  
- âœ… Data Quality Report (**HTML**).  
- âœ… Cleaned dataset (**Dataset-Fixed.csv**).  
- âœ… Written analysis report (**PDF**).  
- âœ… Presentation slides.  
- âœ… Recorded group presentation (15â€“20 minutes).

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  
By completing this project, we will demonstrate the ability to:  
- Produce and interpret a professional data-quality profile.  
- Select and justify correlation measures (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall).  
- Explain associations between explanatory and response variables.  
- Detect and fix common data quality problems programmatically.  
- Recommend and justify predictive approaches (linear regression or alternatives).  
- Present findings clearly in writing and through a video presentation.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Collaboration  
This project emphasizes **reproducibility, interpretability, and collaborative work** while applying real-world data analysis techniques.
